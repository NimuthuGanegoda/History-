                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Abhaya was the eldest son of King Panduvasudeva and succeeded his father as the king of Upatissa Nuwara, ruling for 20 years. He was chosen by his brothers to be the monarch and was known as a just and benevolent ruler. His reign ended when he was deposed by his nephew, Pandukabhaya, who feared that Abhaya would not cede the throne. Despite this, Pandukabhaya later appointed him to the position of 'Nagaraguttika' or guardian of the capital city, Anuradhapura, demonstrating a level of reconciliation and respect between them.</p>
