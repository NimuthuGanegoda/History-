                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Asela was a king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom who heroically restored the Vijayan dynasty after a period of foreign rule. He was the youngest of the nine sons of King Mutasiva. After the two Tamil invaders, Sena and Guttika, had ruled for 22 years, Asela raised an army, defeated them in battle, and reclaimed the throne for the Sinhalese. He ruled from Anuradhapura for ten years. However, his reign was also brought to an end by another invasion from South India, led by a Chola prince named Elara, who defeated and killed Asela to become the next ruler.</p>
