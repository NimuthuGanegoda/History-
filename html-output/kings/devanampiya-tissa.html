                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Devanampiya Tissa, whose name means 'Beloved of the Gods,' was a pivotal monarch of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, best known for officially introducing Buddhism to Sri Lanka. He was the son of King Mutasiva and maintained a close friendship with the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka of India. The most significant event of his reign was the arrival of Arahat Mahinda, Ashoka's son, who converted the king and his court to Buddhism at the historic site of Mihintale. Following his conversion, Devanampiya Tissa became a great patron of the faith, establishing the Mahavihara monastery and building the Thuparama stupa, the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. His reign also saw the arrival of Sanghamitta, Ashoka's daughter, who brought a sapling of the sacred Bodhi Tree from Bodh Gaya, which was planted in Anuradhapura and is revered to this day. His actions firmly rooted Buddhism in Sri Lankan soil, shaping the island's culture and history for centuries.</p>
