                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Elara was a Chola prince from South India who invaded Sri Lanka and took the throne of the Anuradhapura Kingdom by defeating King Asela. Despite being an invader, Elara is renowned in Sri Lankan history for his exceptionally just and impartial rule, which lasted for 44 years. The Mahavamsa chronicle, though a Sinhalese Buddhist text, praises him for his righteousness and describes his 'Bell of Justice,' which citizens could ring to demand his personal attention for any grievance. The most famous legend tells of him ordering the execution of his own son as retribution for a calf that the son's chariot had accidentally killed. His long reign was eventually challenged by the Sinhalese prince Dutugemunu from the south. The conflict culminated in a legendary duel between the two kings on elephant-back, where the elderly Elara was finally defeated and killed. Dutugemunu, in a mark of great respect, had a monument built for Elara and ordered that all should pay respect to it.</p>
