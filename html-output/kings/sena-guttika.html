                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>Sena and Guttika were two Tamil horse traders from South India who became the first recorded foreign rulers of Anuradhapura. After arriving on the island for trade, they organized an army, defeated and killed King Suratissa, and usurped the Sinhalese throne. They ruled jointly for 22 years. The chronicles describe their reign as unrighteous and oppressive, a period during which the local populace suffered. Their rule was eventually ended by Asela, the younger brother of the slain King Suratissa, who raised an army and defeated the two invaders to restore the Vijayan dynasty.</p>
