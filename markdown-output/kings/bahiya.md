# King Bahiya

## Biography

<strong>King Bahiya</strong> (100–98 BCE) – Bahiya continued the transient sequence of rulers during the Valagamba interregnum. His short span underscores factional competition rather than systemic collapse—the agrarian base persisted though central authority flickered. Bahiya's inability to institutionalize support led to replacement by Panya Mara, reaffirming volatility until Valagamba's restoration consolidated rule.
