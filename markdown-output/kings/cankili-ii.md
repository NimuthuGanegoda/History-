# King Cankili II

## Biography

<strong>Cankili II</strong> (1617–1619) – Cankili II, the last independent king of Jaffna, resisted Portuguese conquest for just two years before being captured and executed in 1619. His defiant stand against colonial annexation ended over four centuries of Tamil Hindu kingship in northern Sri Lanka, marking the kingdom's absorption into Portuguese Ceylon.
