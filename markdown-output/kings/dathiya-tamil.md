# King Dathiya (Tamil)

## Biography

<strong>Dathiya</strong> (434–436 CE) – Dathiya (434–436 CE) ruled for two years during the prolonged Tamil occupation. His tenure, like predecessors, lacked enduring cultural or infrastructural markers. Chronicles frame the entire Tamil sequence as illegitimate interregnum, awaiting restoration of rightful Sinhalese kingship.
