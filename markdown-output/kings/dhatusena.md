# King Dhatusena

## Biography

<strong>King Dhatusena</strong> (455–473 CE) – Dhatusena is a heroic restorative figure who expelled Tamil invaders and reclaimed Anuradhapura for Sinhalese rule. His 18-year reign emphasized hydraulic grandeur: he constructed the massive Kala Wewa reservoir, a monumental engineering feat supplying vast irrigation networks. He also restored monasteries damaged during occupation and reinforced Theravāda orthodoxy. However, his reign ended tragically when his son Kashyapa I, fearing disinheritance, imprisoned and killed him. Dhatusena's legacy blends liberation heroism, hydraulic innovation, and familial tragedy.
