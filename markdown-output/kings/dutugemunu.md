# King Dutugemunu

## Biography

Dutugemunu is one of the most celebrated heroes in Sri Lankan history, revered for liberating and unifying the island under a single banner. As the son of King Kavan Tissa of Ruhuna, he was driven from a young age by the desire to expel the Chola king Elara, who ruled Anuradhapura.

After his father's death and a brief conflict with his own brother, Tissa, Dutugemunu launched his famous campaign. Aided by his loyal war elephant, Kandula, and his 'Ten Giant Warriors,' he waged a series of battles, culminating in a legendary elephant-back duel where he defeated and killed the elderly King Elara.

Despite being an adversary, Dutugemunu showed great respect for Elara's bravery, building a monument in his honor. As king, Dutugemunu became a great patron of Buddhism, initiating the construction of some of the most iconic structures in Anuradhapura, including the massive Ruwanwelisaya stupa and the magnificent nine-story Lovamahapaya (Brazen Palace).

His reign is considered a golden age of Sinhalese nationalism and religious devotion.
