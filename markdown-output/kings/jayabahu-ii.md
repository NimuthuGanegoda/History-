## Biography

<strong>Jayabahu II</strong> (1467–1472) – Jayabahu II's brief five-year reign followed his father Parakramabahu VI. He maintained Buddhist ceremonies and Kotte's administrative framework, but lacked the predecessor's unifying force. His short tenure foreshadowed the kingdom's fragmentation into rival principalities.
