# King Kashyapa I

## Biography

<strong>King Kashyapa I</strong> (473–495 CE) – Kashyapa I is one of Sri Lanka's most enigmatic rulers, infamous for patricide and famed for constructing Sigiriya—a fortress-palace atop a monolithic rock. After murdering his father Dhatusena and usurping the throne, he relocated the capital to Sigiriya, creating a defensive stronghold adorned with frescoes and hydraulic gardens. His 22-year reign blended paranoia (fearing his exiled brother Moggallana's vengeance) with artistic brilliance. Eventually, Moggallana returned with an army; Kashyapa I died in battle. His legacy is dual: architectural genius marred by moral transgression, illustrating the tension between aesthetic achievement and ethical kingship.
