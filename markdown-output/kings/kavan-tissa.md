# King Kavan Tissa

## Biography

Kavan Tissa was the king of the southern kingdom of Ruhuna during the period when the northern Anuradhapura Kingdom was under the rule of the Chola king Elara. He is most famously remembered as the father of the heroic Sinhalese king, Dutugemunu. While his son would later wage the war to unify the island, Kavan Tissa's reign was crucial in preparing for this conflict. A shrewd and pious ruler, he focused on strengthening his kingdom from within. He built numerous temples and viharas, fostering a strong sense of national and religious unity. He also gathered the resources and manpower necessary for a future war, including recruiting the 'Ten Giant Warriors' (Dasha Maha Yodhayo) who would later become instrumental in his son's campaign. His strategic foresight laid the essential groundwork for the eventual defeat of Elara and the reunification of Sri Lanka.
