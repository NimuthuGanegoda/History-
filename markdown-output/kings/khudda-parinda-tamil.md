# King Khudda Parinda (Tamil)

## Biography

<strong>Khudda Parinda</strong> (432–434 CE) – Khudda Parinda (432–434 CE) continued the Tamil interregnum for two years. His rule, lacking inscriptional corroboration, is remembered chiefly as part of the foreign occupation sequence disrupting Anuradhapura's Sinhalese dynasty. Limited administrative continuity characterized this volatile interval.
