# King Kuda Tissa

## Biography

<strong>Kuda Tissa</strong> (51–48 BCE) – Kuda Tissa (51–48 BCE) held a short reign likely dominated by maintaining existing royal obligations: ritual sponsorship, adjudication of land boundary disputes, and sustaining granary logistics. Lack of inscriptions or chronicler anecdote points to minimal deviation from inherited policy frameworks. His historical significance is cumulative, preserving the chain leading into late 1st century BCE governance.
