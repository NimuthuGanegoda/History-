# King Kutakanna Tissa

## Biography

<strong>Kutakanna Tissa</strong> (44 BCE–22 BCE) – Kutakanna Tissa (44 BCE–22 BCE) restored longer-duration kingship following rapid turnover. His extended reign enabled re-coordination of taxation, temple endowments, and reservoir maintenance cycles. He likely undertook refurbishment of earlier hydraulic structures to stabilize agrarian yield. Reign longevity suggests success in rebuilding elite consensus eroded by preceding instability and integrating monastic interests with palace governance.
