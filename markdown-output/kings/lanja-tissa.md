# King Lanja Tissa

## Biography

<strong>King Lanja Tissa</strong> (119–109 BCE) – Lanja Tissa governed during a period of internal court faction balancing after rapid turnover. His decade suggests adequate consolidation of elite and monastic support. While grand architectural feats are not directly tied to him, he maintained existing stupas and irrigation works—essential for agrarian surplus. Chronic silence on controversy implies effective, moderate stewardship. His reign contributed to restoring rhythm to state administration after successive short-lived predecessors.
