# Queen Lilavati

## Biography

<strong>Queen Lilavati</strong> (1197–1200, 1209–1210, 1211–1212) – Queen Lilavati ruled in three separate intervals, an extraordinary pattern of repeated accession and displacement. Her tenures reflect intense factional struggle among Polonnaruwa elites. Despite instability, she maintained administrative continuity through strategic court alliances. Her repeated sovereignty underscores both female political agency and the dynasty's terminal fragmentation.
