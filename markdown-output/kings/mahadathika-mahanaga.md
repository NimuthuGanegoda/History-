# King Mahadathika Mahanaga

## Biography

<strong>Mahadathika Mahanaga</strong> (7–19 CE) – Mahadathika Mahanaga (7–19 CE) maintained continuity into the early Common Era, a period where Anuradhapura's hydraulic base matured further. He likely authorized periodic reservoir desilting and reinforced monastic legal privileges (immunity over certain lands). His rule exemplifies evolutionary rather than revolutionary kingship—refining inherited systems.
