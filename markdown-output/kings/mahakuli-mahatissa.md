# King Mahakuli Mahatissa

## Biography

<strong>Mahakuli Mahatissa</strong> (77–63 BCE) – Mahakuli Mahatissa (77–63 BCE), succeeding the turbulence preceding Valagamba's stabilized era, presided over a phase of consolidation. He reinforced revenue normalization—reaffirming land grants and ensuring reservoir maintenance cycles resumed predictably. Though not associated with fresh monumental edifices, he helped diffuse lingering factionalism by emphasizing continuity of Buddhist patronage and administrative routine.
