# King Mahanama

## Biography

<strong>Mahanama</strong> (406–428 CE) – Mahanama (406–428 CE) ruled during a transitional period marked by increasing South Indian incursions. His 22-year reign focused on defensive fortification, monastic patronage, and irrigation maintenance. His era witnessed early signs of external pressure that would later disrupt Anuradhapura, yet he sustained internal stability through traditional legitimization mechanisms: Buddhist merit and hydraulic stewardship.
