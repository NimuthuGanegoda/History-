# King Mahinda V

## Biography

<strong>Mahinda V</strong> (982–1017 CE) – Mahinda V represents the tragic denouement of Anuradhapura's millennial reign. His 35-year nominal rule witnessed escalating Chola invasions from South India, culminating in the sacking of Anuradhapura (993 CE) and his eventual capture. Unable to defend the capital, the kingdom fragmented; the Tooth Relic and royal authority migrated southward. His reign marks the end of Anuradhapura as the primary capital, transitioning power toward Polonnaruwa. Mahinda V's legacy is one of systemic collapse—external pressure overwhelming an aging hydraulic state.
