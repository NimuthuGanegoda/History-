# King Mayadunne

## Biography

<strong>Mayadunne</strong> (1521–1581) – Mayadunne founded the independent Sitawaka kingdom, resisting Portuguese expansion for 60 years. He waged continuous guerrilla warfare against both Kotte's Portuguese-backed rulers and colonial garrisons. His fierce anti-colonial stance preserved Sinhalese sovereignty in the interior, laying the foundation for his son Rajasinha's campaigns.
