# King Moggallana I

## Biography

<strong>King Moggallana I</strong> (495–512 CE) – Moggallana I reclaimed the throne from his brother Kashyapa I after defeating him in battle. His 17-year reign focused on restoring Anuradhapura as the capital, abandoning Sigiriya's fortress isolation. He emphasized Buddhist reconciliation, sponsoring monastic communities and reinforcing orthodox Theravāda practices. His rule sought to legitimize his succession through piety and administrative normalization, distancing his reign from Kashyapa's parricide stigma.
