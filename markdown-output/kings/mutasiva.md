# King Mutasiva

## Biography

Mutasiva was a king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom who enjoyed a long and peaceful reign of 60 years. He was the son of the illustrious King Pandukabhaya. His most significant contribution was the creation of the Mahamevnāwa (Great Clouds) Park in Anuradhapura, a beautifully landscaped garden that he laid out with fruit and flowering trees. This park would later become a site of immense religious importance, as it was where the sacred Bodhi tree was planted during the reign of his successor. Mutasiva had ten sons and two daughters, and several of his sons, including Devanampiya Tissa, Uttiya, and Mahasiva, would go on to rule the kingdom in succession.
