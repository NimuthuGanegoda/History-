# King Niliya

## Biography

<strong>Niliya</strong> (47–46 BCE) – Niliya (47–46 BCE) marginally extended stability beyond single-year transitions, yet still too short for major programmatic undertakings. Administrative survival relied on irrigation steward autonomy and monastic land management continuity. His rule contributes a temporal buffer before the dramatic sequence culminating in Queen Anula.
