# King Nissanka Malla

## Biography

<strong>Nissanka Malla</strong> (1187–1196) – Nissanka Malla ruled for nine years, sustaining Polonnaruwa's grandeur after Parakramabahu I's death. He commissioned numerous inscriptions proclaiming his piety and legitimacy (he was not of direct royal lineage, requiring extra legitimization). He built temples, sponsored festivals, and maintained irrigation works. His reign emphasized continuity through ostentatious Buddhist patronage, yet underlying succession instability began surfacing.
