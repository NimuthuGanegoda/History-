# King Pandu (Tamil)

## Biography

<strong>Pandu</strong> (430–432 CE) – Pandu (430–432 CE), a Tamil invader, usurped the throne during a period of Anuradhapura fragility. His brief two-year rule lacked enduring administrative or cultural imprints; chronicles frame him as an illegitimate oppressor. His reign exemplifies external opportunism exploiting internal weaknesses, setting a pattern of Tamil intervention that recurred periodically.
