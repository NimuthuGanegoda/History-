# King Pandukabhaya

## Biography

Pandukabhaya is a legendary king of Sri Lanka and the first monarch of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. His story is one of destiny and perseverance; born to Princess Unmada Chitra, he was hidden at birth to protect him from his uncles, who had been foretold that he would kill them. Raised in secrecy, he eventually waged a seventeen-year war against his uncles, defeated them, and unified the island. He established Anuradhapura as his capital, a city he meticulously planned and developed. His reign of 70 years was marked by significant achievements, including the construction of reservoirs (such as the Abhaya Wewa), the establishment of a formal administrative system, and the peaceful integration of different clans. He is considered one of the most important early kings of Sri Lanka.
