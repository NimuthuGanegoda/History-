# King Panduvasudeva

## Biography

Panduvasudeva was the first monarch of the Kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara, reigning for 30 years. He was the nephew of his predecessor, King Vijaya, and was summoned from Sinhapura, India, to continue the royal lineage. He arrived in Sri Lanka with 32 followers and later married Princess Buddhakachchana, a relative of the Buddha, who arrived with her own retinue. Their marriage and his coronation solidified the Vijayan dynasty. Together, they had ten sons and one daughter, Unmada Chitra. His reign was foundational for the new kingdom, establishing a stable succession and strengthening ties with Indian royalty.
