# King Panya Mara

## Biography

<strong>King Panya Mara</strong> (98–91 BCE) – Panya Mara further exemplifies the chain of ephemeral rulers preceding Valagamba's return. Chronicles emphasize duration over deeds; thus his historical interpretation revolves around absence—no major reforms, monuments, or doctrinal shifts recorded. His reign deepens the pattern of contested sovereignty that later legitimizes Valagamba's narrative of rightful reclamation.
