# King Parakramabahu I

## Biography

<strong>Parakramabahu I</strong> (1153–1186) – Parakramabahu I, known as 'Parakramabahu the Great,' is Polonnaruwa's most celebrated monarch. His 33-year reign transformed the capital into a hydraulic and architectural marvel: constructing the massive Parakrama Samudra reservoir, magnificent palace complexes, and ornate Buddhist temples (Vatadage, Lankathilaka). He unified fractious regional kingdoms, conducted military campaigns into South India and Burma, and patronized literature and the arts. His famous maxim—'Not a drop of water should reach the sea without serving man'—epitomizes his hydraulic vision. His reign represents Polonnaruwa's zenith: political unity, economic prosperity, and cultural brilliance.
