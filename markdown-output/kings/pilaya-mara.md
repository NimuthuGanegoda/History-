# King Pilaya Mara

## Biography

<strong>Pilaya Mara</strong> (91–90 BCE) – Pilaya Mara (91–90 BCE) held power briefly within the competitive milieu of post-overthrow Anuradhapura. Administrative machinery likely functioned in minimalist preservation mode: collecting staple grain levies, guarding central storehouses, and placating monastic communities sufficiently to avoid open revolt. Swift succession afterward signals limited coalition breadth.
