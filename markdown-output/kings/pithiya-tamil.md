# King Pithiya (Tamil)

## Biography

<strong>Pithiya</strong> (436–437 CE) – Pithiya (436–437 CE) concluded the Tamil usurpation period with a brief one-year rule. His displacement marked the end of nearly a decade of foreign control, setting the stage for Dhatusena's restorative campaign and the re-establishment of Sinhalese sovereignty.
