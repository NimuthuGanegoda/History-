# King Pulahatta

## Biography

<strong>King Pulahatta</strong> (103–100 BCE) – Pulahatta participated in the brief line of usurpers following Valagamba's early overthrow. Foreign-aligned or opportunistic military backing enabled his rise. His government, lacking enduring cultural or hydraulic markers, is remembered chiefly as part of the interregnum that fractured legitimate dynastic continuity. Removal by Bahiya demonstrates rapid turnover symptomatic of low internal legitimacy.
