## Biography

<strong>Rajasinha II</strong> (1635–1687) – Rajasinha II's monumental 52-year reign expelled the Portuguese from the island with Dutch help, though he inadvertently exchanged one colonial overlord for another. He patronized Buddhist art, built the Temple of the Tooth, and defended highland sovereignty. His era defines Kandy's golden age of resistance.
