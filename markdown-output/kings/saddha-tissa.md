# King Saddha Tissa

## Biography

<strong>King Saddha Tissa</strong> (137–119 BCE) – Saddha Tissa, younger brother of Dutugemunu, inherited a newly unified Anuradhapura where monumental Buddhist projects and hydraulic expansion had accelerated. His reign focused on consolidation: safeguarding stupas (notably Ruwanwelisaya), completing ancillary monastic buildings, and standardizing maintenance of irrigation networks. Chronicles imply he preserved the ideological synthesis of kingship and Buddhist patronage without embarking on the dramatic military campaigns of his predecessor. Stability and infrastructural continuity define his legacy, providing a calm pivot between the heroic age of conquest and subsequent routine governance.
