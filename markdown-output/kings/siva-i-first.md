## Biography

<strong>Siva I</strong> (48–47 BCE) – Siva I (48–47 BCE) represents a brief transitional kingship. In the absence of recorded doctrinal controversy or external invasion, he likely functioned as an interim stabilizer. The ephemeral nature of his reign underscores the adaptability of bureaucratic and monastic networks to rapid royal turnover without systemic collapse.
