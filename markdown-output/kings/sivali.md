## Biography

<strong>Queen Sivali</strong> (33 CE) – Queen Sivali (33 CE) stands alongside Queen Anula as evidence that female rulership, though rare, emerged during succession turbulence. Her extremely short tenure limited capacity for policy imprint; nevertheless, her recorded sovereignty underscores fluidity in late early-era dynastic transitions and the potential elevation of royal women during crises.
