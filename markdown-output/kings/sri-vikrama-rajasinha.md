# King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha

## Biography

<strong>Sri Vikrama Rajasinha</strong> (1798–1815) – Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last king of Kandy, ruled for 17 years before British annexation in 1815. His autocratic style alienated the nobility, who collaborated with the British to depose him. His capture and exile to India closed over two millennia of continuous Sinhalese monarchy.
