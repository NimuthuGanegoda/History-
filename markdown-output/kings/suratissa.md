# King Suratissa

## Biography

Suratissa was a king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom who succeeded his elder brother, Mahasiva. He was a devout follower of Buddhism and is credited with building numerous viharas (monasteries) throughout his kingdom, totaling around 500 religious shrines. His reign, however, came to an abrupt and violent end. Two horse traders from South India, named Sena and Guttika, mounted an invasion, defeated King Suratissa in battle, and usurped the throne. This event marks the first recorded instance of a foreign invasion and rule over the Anuradhapura Kingdom, breaking the Vijayan dynasty for a period of 22 years.
