# King Thulatthana

## Biography

<strong>King Thulatthana</strong> (119 BCE) – Thulatthana ruled so briefly that no major inscriptions or enduring public works are attributed to him. His accession—likely through established dynastic succession protocols—illustrates episodic short reigns during intervals of political recalibration. The lack of chronicler censure suggests administrative normality rather than upheaval; he functions historically as a temporal bridge between longer-reigning monarchs, reflecting the fragility of immediate succession in late 2nd century BCE Anuradhapura.
