# Tissa (regent)

## Biography

Tissa was the younger brother of King Abhaya and became the regent of Upatissa Nuwara after Abhaya was deposed. He was one of the ten sons of King Panduvasudeva. His time as regent was defined by a prolonged power struggle with his nephew, Pandukabhaya, the son of their sister Unmada Chitra. Tissa and his other brothers waged war against Pandukabhaya for seventeen years, a conflict that ultimately ended in Tissa's defeat and death. His regency represents the final period of the Upatissa Nuwara kingdom before the capital shifted to Anuradhapura under Pandukabhaya.
