# King Uttiya

## Biography

Uttiya was a king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom who succeeded his elder brother, the renowned King Devanampiya Tissa. His ten-year reign is historically significant primarily because it marks the passing of the two central figures who introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka: Arahant Mahinda and his sister, Sanghamitta Theri. Arahant Mahinda passed away in the eighth year of Uttiya's reign, and the king held a grand funeral for him, building a stupa on the site of his cremation at Mihintale. Sanghamitta Theri passed away the following year, and she was also honored with a stupa. These events underscore the consolidation of Buddhism as the state religion during his time.
