# King Valagamba (Vattagamani Abhaya)

## Biography

<strong>King Valagamba (Vattagamani Abhaya)</strong> (103, 89–77 BCE) – Valagamba first lost the throne in 103 BCE amid South Indian challenger pressure and internal instability, then reclaimed it (89–77 BCE) after prolonged exile. His restoration symbolizes resilience and strategic regional alliance building in Ruhuna. During his second reign, the Buddhist Sangha reputedly commenced transcription of portions of the Tipitaka at Aluvihara—transitioning oral canon toward written preservation (a tradition later expanded). He reinforced monastic endowments and stabilized agrarian tax flows ravaged by previous disruptions. His narrative frames themes of exile, religious textual safeguarding, and political rejuvenation.
