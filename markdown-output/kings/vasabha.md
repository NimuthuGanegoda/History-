# King Vasabha

## Biography

<strong>King Vasabha</strong> (67–111 CE) – Vasabha stands as a pivotal hydraulic innovator, credited with constructing eleven major reservoirs (tanks) that expanded Anuradhapura's irrigable acreage significantly. His lengthy 44-year reign enabled systemic agrarian intensification: improved water distribution, higher rice yields, and stronger revenue flows. He also sponsored numerous temples, embedding his legitimacy within both material prosperity and Buddhist merit-making. Vasabha's engineering legacy influenced subsequent kings' emphasis on tank construction as royal duty.
