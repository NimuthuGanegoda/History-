# King Vatuka

## Biography

<strong>Vatuka</strong> (47 BCE) – Vatuka (47 BCE) is noted only by name and year, exemplifying ultrashort succession anomalies. His accession and displacement highlight intense elite competition—possibly between military commanders or regional noble lineages. Such flash reigns rarely possess capacity for infrastructure or religious initiatives; continuity rested with entrenched local officials.
