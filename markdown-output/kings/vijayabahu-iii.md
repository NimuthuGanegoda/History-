# King Vijayabahu III

## Biography

<strong>Vijayabahu III</strong> (1236–1270) – Vijayabahu III established Dambadeniya as the new capital after expelling Kalinga Magha's forces from Polonnaruwa. His 34-year reign focused on reconstruction: rebuilding monasteries, restoring Buddhist ordination lineages, and fortifying the new capital. Operating from a smaller hydraulic base, he adapted kingship to a more modest scale—emphasizing religious legitimacy and regional alliance-building over grand irrigation projects. His reign symbolizes Sinhalese resilience and adaptive state reformation.
