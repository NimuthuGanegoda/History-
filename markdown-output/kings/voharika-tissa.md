# King Voharika Tissa

## Biography

<strong>Voharika Tissa</strong> (245–247 CE) – Voharika Tissa (245–247 CE) is noted in chronicles for measures against extremist ascetic factions—possibly Mahayana or heterodox Theravāda sects perceived as destabilizing orthodox monastic hierarchy. His brief two-year reign's doctrinal interventions reflect ongoing tension between royal authority and diverse monastic groups. His policies set context for subsequent rulers navigating religious pluralism.
